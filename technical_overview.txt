Multi-Agent Research Assistant - Technical Overview

Architecture:
The system follows a multi-agent architecture with four specialized agents:
1. Orchestrator: Manages workflow and coordinates other agents
2. Researcher: Conducts web/document research
3. Analyzer: Synthesizes information and resolves conflicts
4. Writer: Generates the final report

Components:
- FastAPI backend for REST interface
- LangChain framework for agent capabilities
- Redis for task queue (basic implementation)
- Docker containers for isolation
- Streamlit for web interface

Agent Design Decisions:
1. Specialization:
   - Each agent has a distinct responsibility
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Optimized prompts for each role

2. Communication:
   - Direct method calls between agents
   - Shared state through storage service
   - Activity logging for traceability

3. Error Handling:
   - Basic try-catch blocks
   - Status tracking for tasks
   - Error propagation to API

Tradeoffs Considered:
1. Simplicity vs Flexibility:
   - Chose straightforward agent roles over dynamic role assignment
   - Easier to maintain but less adaptable

2. Local Storage vs Database:
   - Used local JSON storage for simplicity
   - Sacrificed scalability for easier setup

3. Synchronous vs Asynchronous:
   - Mixed approach based on needs
   - API endpoints async for performance
   - Some agent operations synchronous for simplicity

Performance Considerations:
1. Token Usage:
   - Basic budgeting through prompt design
   - No advanced optimization

2. Parallelism:
   - Limited to Docker container level
   - No intra-agent parallel processing

3. Caching:
   - Simple file-based caching
   - No advanced memoization

Future Extension Points:
1. Add proper database backend
2. Implement more sophisticated task queue
3. Enhance error recovery mechanisms
4. Add agent performance monitoring

Key Strengths:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand architecture
- Straightforward deployment
- Good foundation for extension
