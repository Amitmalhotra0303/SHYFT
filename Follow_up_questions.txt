Multi-Agent Research Assistant - Follow-up Questions Answers

1. Scaling for Hundreds of Concurrent Research Tasks

To handle hundreds of concurrent tasks, we would implement:

Horizontal Scaling:

Deploy multiple instances of agents behind a load balancer

Containerize each agent type for independent scaling

Use Kubernetes for orchestration of containerized agents

Task Management:

Implement Redis or RabbitMQ for distributed task queuing

Add priority queues for different research depths (quick/balanced/deep)

Introduce task batching for similar research topics

Performance Optimization:

Add caching layer for common research queries

Implement result memoization to avoid duplicate research

Use vector databases for efficient knowledge retrieval

Resource Management:

Add rate limiting to external API calls

Implement token usage budgeting per task

Introduce auto-scaling based on queue length

Monitoring:

Add Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for system metrics

Implement agent performance tracking

Set up alerts for system bottlenecks

2. Security Considerations for Autonomous Agents

Input Security:

Implement strict input validation for research queries

Add sanitization for web content processing

Use allowlists for acceptable domains in web research

API Security:

Add JWT authentication for API endpoints

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

Use API gateways for request filtering

Data Security:

Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit

Implement proper API key management

Add audit logging for all agent activities

Agent Safety:

Implement content filtering for research results

Add hallucination detection mechanisms

Create sandboxed execution environments

Operational Security:

Regular security audits of agent behavior

Implement circuit breakers for external services

Add anomaly detection for unusual activity patterns

3. Feedback Mechanism for Continuous Improvement

Feedback Collection:

Add user rating system (1-5 stars) for reports

Implement "report correction" interface

Collect implicit feedback through usage metrics

Feedback Processing:

Store feedback in vector database for semantic search

Categorize feedback by agent and task type

Calculate performance metrics from feedback

Agent Adaptation:

Adjust agent prompts based on feedback analysis

Implement A/B testing for different approaches

Create feedback loops for source credibility scoring

Implementation Approach:

Add feedback API endpoints:

POST /feedback {task_id, rating, corrections}

GET /feedback/summary {agent_name}

Create Feedback Processor service that:

Analyzes feedback patterns

Updates agent knowledge bases

Adjusts agent parameters

Implement periodic retraining:

Weekly review of feedback trends

Update prompt templates

Adjust decision thresholds

4. Adding Domain-Specific Capabilities

Knowledge Integration:

Create domain-specific knowledge bases

Add specialized document loaders for domain formats

Implement domain-aware chunking strategies

Agent Specialization:

Create domain-specific agent variants

Add domain experts as sub-agents

Implement routing to domain specialists

Domain Awareness:

Add domain classification layer

Implement domain-specific evaluation metrics

Create domain-focused research strategies
